# Predict wine quality with supervised models

The wine quality dataset (winequality.txt) contains 11 explanatory variables characterizing 1200 wine quality
evaluations. The class informs us whether the wine was qualified as good or not:

# Explanatory variables for the wine quality dataset
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Class membership variable for the wine quality dataset
- Class: good, notgood

# Models used
We'll use the following algorithms to model the wine quality data and predict whether a wine will be qualified as good or not

- Support Vector Machines 
- Classification Trees 
- Random Forests 
- k-Nearest Neighbors
